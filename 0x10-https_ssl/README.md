0x10. HTTPS SSL

Overview:
0x10 is a hexadecimal representation of the binary value 16, commonly associated with the hexadecimal numbering system. In the context of HTTPS SSL (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/Secure Sockets Layer), 0x10 often refers to the SSL/TLS version 1.0.

HTTPS SSL:
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website you are connected to. HTTPS ensures secure communication over a computer network by encrypting the data exchanged between the client (browser) and the server. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are the protocols that provide this secure connection.

SSL Version 1.0 (0x10):
SSL version 1.0, represented as 0x10 in hexadecimal, was the first iteration of the SSL protocol, released by Netscape in 1994. However, SSL 1.0 was never publicly released due to security flaws, and it was quickly replaced by SSL 2.0. SSL 2.0 also had significant security vulnerabilities and was replaced by SSL 3.0 in 1996. Since then, SSL has evolved into TLS, with TLS 1.0 being the successor to SSL 3.0.
